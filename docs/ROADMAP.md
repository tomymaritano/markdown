## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- **Vector Database**: For semantic search capabilities (Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma)
- **LLM API**: For natural language processing (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models)
- **Analytics Storage**: For search analytics and user behavior tracking
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Library for performance optimization (react-window or react-virtualized)
- **Text Analytics**: For writing analysis and insights (spaCy, NLTK, or cloud APIs)
- **Grammar/Spell Check**: Language processing APIs (LanguageTool, Grammarly API)
- **Content Classification**: Machine learning models for auto-tagging and organization

### Performance Targets

- **Search Response Time**: < 200ms for fuzzy search, < 500ms for semantic search
- **AI Response Time**: < 2s for auto-completion, < 5s for content generation
- **UI Responsiveness**: Search results should appear incrementally
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of large note collections (10,000+ notes)
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent cache invalidation and prefetching
- **AI Processing**: Background processing for non-critical AI features

### Architecture Considerations

- **Modular Design**: Search and AI features should be pluggable and configurable
- **Offline Support**: Core functionality should work offline, AI features gracefully degrade
- **Scalability**: Architecture should support both local and cloud-based processing
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom search providers and AI models
- **Privacy**: Option for local AI processing vs cloud APIs
- **Cost Management**: Intelligent API usage and caching to minimize costs

## 📝 Notes

- All features marked as "Low Priority" to align with current project focus
- Timeline estimates are for full-time development and may vary based on available resources
- Dependencies should be evaluated for licensing, cost, and maintenance implications
- User feedback should drive prioritization of specific features within each category
